    "## 1. Introduction to LangChain and RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework and Python library designed to help you build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle by providing abstractions for integrating various components in order to make applications easy to deploy and scalable. Various components like document loaders, embeddings, vector databases, chains and more, make up your application's cognitive architecture. You can read more about langchain [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by combining information retrieval with text generation. When a query is posed, a retrieval system searches through a knowledge base, a vast corpus of documents or databases, to find relevant information that can address the query. This additional context is then fed into the language model along with the original query, in order to generate a coherent response. RAG allows us to incorporate up-to-date and specific information that may not have been present in the model's training data, making it particularly valuable for personalized applications."
